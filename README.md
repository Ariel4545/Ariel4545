- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Ariel4545  
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in making all kind of python programs especially ones including ui/ux  
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning python's libaries, sql  
- ðŸ“« How to reach me - discord(username='Arielp2#4011')  
## Why there aren't many updates  
there aren't many updates because I'm an high school student,  
that is packed with a lot of tests and finals all in a few  
months duration - that requires an insane amout of dedication to school.  
## EgonTE state  
EgonTE v1.11.2 was delayed, the version was intended  
to release on 15/4 but will be in the current state it will be on 22/4 at best.  
after this update, new updates might not come in a long period of time.   
## other programs  
the other programs didn't get an update in a very  
long time, but many of them are paused in mid development process  
and will be continued to be worked as soon as possible  

# What the future holds (as of 27/5):  

## Personal statement:
At the end of June, I'll be relieved from all the school finals.  
I have many upcoming projects in my personal life like being better at Psychical health  
and also to be more socially compatible.  
But one of my biggest planned projects - "EgonX" or whatever I'll call it  
will be similar to the "new year (Egon) update" - it's only planned as right now so don't expect it too-much  

## How it will be:  
In short, because most programs are close to their highest potential it won't be too drastic of an update  
however, because I have more time to research, you can expect to have so pretty good features and be more polished.  

## Additionally, the less main programs will probably get updates as well:  
1. Minecraft clone  

## Programs Ideas/prototypes that are possible to come to life:  
1. Image Editor  
2. Screen recorder  
3. Auto clicker 
4. Discord bot
