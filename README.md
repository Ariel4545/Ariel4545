- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Ariel4545  
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in making all kind of python programs especially ones including ui/ux  
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning python's libaries, sql  
- ðŸ“« How to reach me - discord(username='Arielp2#4011')  
## Why there aren't many updates  
there aren't many updates because I'm an high school student,  
that is packed with a lot of tests and finals all in a few  
months duration - that requires an insane amout of dedication to school.  
## EgonTE state  
EgonTE will receive its next big update this month! (probably)  
EgonTE v1.12 will be probably released between the 16th - 30th of august 2023  
this update will focus more on making the program more "finished" then making completely new additions,  
this includes a little bit better UI, many fixes, better usage of what the program contains,  
more settings,  new mechanics, and more...  
Stay tuned!  
## other programs  
the other programs didn't get an update in a very  
long time, but many of them are paused in mid development process  
and will be continued to be worked as soon as possible  
  
## Additionally, the less main programs will probably get updates as well:  
1. Minecraft clone  

## Programs Ideas/prototypes that are possible to come to life:  
1. Image Editor  
2. Screen recorder  
3. Auto clicker 
4. Discord bot
