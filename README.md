- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Ariel4545  
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in making all kind of python programs especially ones including ui/ux  
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning python's libaries, sql  
- ðŸ“« How to reach me - discord(username='Arielp2#4011')  
## EgonTE state  
The state of the program as of now (24/10/13).  
is that although I have plans for the next update (1.12.2)  
I will take matters at a slower pace and do different things  
and not work on the main version for now.  
instead, the plan for now is to make a special/sliced version of the original  
program, the versions will be much lighter, have better UI for their  
purpose, and sometimes will have small features that will be exsulsive  
(for now).  
## EgonIDE
The next project Iâ€™m going to introduce is the Ariel/Egon IDE,  
itâ€™s initially started as a mini version of the text editor but grew quick  
To be its own thing, there are many specific tools to create a comfortable programming environment  
and many irrelevant things that were thrown to not make it a heavy program  
It will probably be released on 12/1/23  
## other programs  
the other programs didn't get an update in a very  
long time, but many of them are paused in mid development process  
and will be continued to be worked as soon as possible
