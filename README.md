# General statement (29/6/24)  
Hello fellas, 
I've finished high school, I have in the meantime (while I'm still in a transitional period) more means to continue and expand on my projects.  
So it's exactly what I'm doing - stay tuned!  

## EgonTE state (29/6/24)  
EgonTE's update is being worked on tirelessly lately.  
Upcoming update's core goal is to improve the code quality and organization.  
But there will still be some improvements/additions that will appeal to UI-only users.  
I can't still tell you when the update will come out, its scale, and what to expect - because I'm in the midst of developing it.
