# General statement (22/8/24)  
Hey guys, I've become busy sooner than expected, but it doesn't mean that there isn't new stuff coming.  

EgonTE became very complex to work on (even on basic stuff), and I got many burnouts just from opening the project, so until the next update that will come eventually;  
I started to work on new programs, some of which will be released soon.  

thank you for being so patient.  

## EgonTE state (29/6/24)  
EgonTE's update is being worked on tirelessly lately.  
Upcoming update's core goal is to improve the code quality and organization.  
But there will still be some improvements/additions that will appeal to UI-only users.  
I can't still tell you when the update will come out, its scale, and what to expect - because I'm in the midst of developing it.  

## Special update 17/9  
I lost most of my free time recently,
So in an effort to not delay the updates too much further, I will start to round up the updates and try to release them quickly
