- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Ariel4545  
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in making all kind of python programs especially ones including ui/ux  
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning python's libaries, sql  
- ðŸ“« How to reach me - discord(username='arielp2')  
## EgonTE state (28/11/13)  
The state of the program as of now.  
That EgonTE got many updates in a short period of time,  
because of the __support I got__ from sharing the project.  
and even though most of what I planned is already out,  
there are some __more things__ you can expect to come sooner or later  

(__In addition__, there is a basic version that will maybe come soon)  

## EgonIDE (28/11/13)  
The next project Iâ€™m going to introduce is the Egon IDE,  
 It _initially started as a mini version_ of the text editor but grew quickly  
 to be its own unique thing.  
there are many specific tools to create a comfortable programming environment.  
furthermore many irrelevant to the purpose of the project were removed to reduce the size of the program and thus make it lighter.  
 It will probably be __released on 1/1/24__  
(_delayed because of school and the EgonTE support_)
