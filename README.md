# Why there aren't many updates  
there aren't many updates because I'm an high school student,  
that is packed with a lot of tests and finals all in a few  
months duration - that requires an insane amout of dedication to school.  
## EgonTE state  
EgonTE v1.11.2 was delayed, the version was intended  
to release on 15/4 but will be in the current state it will be on 22/4 at best.  
after this update, new updates might not come in a long period of time.   
## other programs  
the other programs didn't get an update in a very  
long time, but many of them are paused in mid development process  
and will be continued to be worked as soon as possible
