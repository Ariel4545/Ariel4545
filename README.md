## EgonTE state (28/12/13)  
EgonTE state 28/12/23
EgonTE is now almost complete, now there will be a focus on all of the features that were not properly tested because of Venv errors,  
In addition, there will be improvements to outdated things like UI elements.  
Microsoft store:  
Despite the initial expectations I decided that EgonTE is still not ready to be an executable, and in addition, there are still many problems that I will need to solve in the process of converting the project to an executable.  
# 1.12.5  
the 1.12.5 update will be around the size of all the updates from the 1.12.x series,  
the update will probably be released between 20-30 January 2024,  
in addition, the update's best features are UI improvement to outdated tools and improvement to outdated UI elements + fixes and QOL of life features  

## EgonIDE (28/11/13)  
The next project Iâ€™m going to introduce is the Egon IDE,  
 It _initially started as a mini version_ of the text editor but grew quickly  
 to be its own unique thing.  
there are many specific tools to create a comfortable programming environment.  
furthermore many irrelevant to the purpose of the project were removed to reduce the size of the program and thus make it lighter.  
 It will probably be __released on 1/1/24__  
(_delayed because of school and the EgonTE support_)
