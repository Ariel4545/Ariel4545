## EgonTE state (28/11/13)  
EgonTE state 28/12/23
EgonTE is now almost complete, now there will be a focus on all of the features that were not properly tested because of Venv errors,  
In addition, there will be improvements to some outdated things like some UI elements.  
Microsoft store:  
In spite of the initial expectations I decided that EgonTE is still not ready to be an executable, and in addition, there are still many problems that I will need to solve in the process of converting the project to an executable.  

## EgonIDE (28/11/13)  
The next project Iâ€™m going to introduce is the Egon IDE,  
 It _initially started as a mini version_ of the text editor but grew quickly  
 to be its own unique thing.  
there are many specific tools to create a comfortable programming environment.  
furthermore many irrelevant to the purpose of the project were removed to reduce the size of the program and thus make it lighter.  
 It will probably be __released on 1/1/24__  
(_delayed because of school and the EgonTE support_)
