- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Ariel4545  
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in making all kind of python programs especially ones including ui/ux  
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning python's libaries, sql  
- ðŸ“« How to reach me - discord(username='Arielp2#4011')  
## EgonTE state  
The state of the program as of now (24/10/13).  
is that although I have plans for the next update (1.12.2)  
I will take matters at a slower pace and do different things  
and not work on the main version for now.  
instead, the plan for now is to make a special/sliced version of the original  
program, the versions will be much lighter, have better UI for their  
purpose, and sometimes will have small features that will be exsulsive  
(for now).  
## other programs  
the other programs didn't get an update in a very  
long time, but many of them are paused in mid development process  
and will be continued to be worked as soon as possible  
  
## Additionally, the less main programs will probably get updates as well:  
1. Minecraft clone  

## Programs Ideas/prototypes that are possible to come to life:  
1. Image Editor  
2. Screen recorder  
3. Auto clicker 
4. Discord bot
